<i>Some time in October, 2017</i>

<p>
I forgot why I was there in that little cul-de-sac that late night in October of 2017. Oh yes, I was buying a monitor off of a guy on Kijiji. I started playing Dota again, and the monitor on my little macbook was really driving me crazy so I decided to get a bigger one.
</p>

<p>
The neighborhood seemed nice. It seemed pretty hip, for Sunnyvale standards. I could hear some neighbors having a party. I started to feel a bit scared, but then I remembered Sunnyvale was one of the safest neighborhoods in the Bay Area so I laughed to myself and faked some confidence. When I showed up to the door, I saw what looked to be a middle aged, single man, who looked a bit down on his luck. He had some European accent that I couldn't really identify. After testing the monitor and exchanging some awkward pleasantries, he suddenly noticed the logo on my bag.
</p>

<p>
"Oath? You know, I just got laid off from there."
</p>

<p>
"Oh. Sorry to hear that... I just started interning there now"
</p>

<p>
I wasn't really sure if I should have said that, since it would seem hard to come as empathetic maybe even in some ways shoving some salt in the wound. He didn't really seem that insulted. In fact, his face started to creep into a slight smile.
</p>

<p>
"Funny how life is sometimes."
</p>

<p>
I paid for the monitor and the cables and left for the street corner. It was getting pretty late, so I called for an Uber straight to the place I was staying at. <i>15 minutes away.</i> I figured I'd just have to stand and wait there awkwardly with monitor in hand, when a group of people who were pretty clearly drunk and having a good time came up to me. 
</p>

<p>A pretty attractive middle aged woman, clearly oblivious to how loud she was, started shouting to me:
</p>

<p>
"Hay!! What's your story kid? What's with the monitor?"
</p>

<p>
I replied plainly about buying the monitor.
</p>

<p>
"Where you from kid? You don't look like your from around here"
</p>

<p>
"Canada, I'm just here on an internship"
</p>

<p>
"Canada? Aha aha, how's that anthem go - O Canadaaaaaaaaa ... Dun dun dun dun dun dunning - wait where are you interning, a guy like you, probably works at Apple or Google or something"
</p>

<p>
At this point, they seemed friendly enough, but I didn't really like dealing with drunk people while sober so I tried to just give one word answers in hopes they'd leave me alone.
</p>

<p>
"Oath."
</p>

<p>
"BOTH? Holy shit are you serious"
</p>

<p>
"No I mean Oath, like Yahoo."
</p>

<p>
"Oh what? Yahoo is on the way down kid. Come down to LinkedIN! We're all recruiters! We need some folks like you."
</p>

<p>
"Uh. Okay, yeah sure" 
</p>

<p>
<i>Like me? What does that mean exactly?</i>
</p>

<p>
"Honestly kid you look pretty manly - it's kinda hot. Usually rare for people like you!"
</p>

<i>Okay now I feel a little insulted.</i>

<p>
"Mm hmm."
</p>

<p>
They started laughing pretty hard at that point. Didn't really know what to make of it. In retrospect, I would've actually gotten their contact info, just for the heck of it, but at that moment, as if to save me from embarrassing myself anymore, the Uber came. I waved goodbye and left. The driver probably thought they were my friends.
</p>

<p>
After that day, there was no more doubt in my mind that I was in Silicon Valley, and all the cultural ticks that came along with it.
