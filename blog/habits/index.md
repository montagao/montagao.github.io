Right this second, are you spending your time in the most productive way possible?  

Is it as conducive as it can be to becoming the person you want to become?

How can you best achieve who you want to be in life?

I think about this question often, and even though I read a lot of books on the subject, I've always wanted to 
condense whatever knowledge I have easily digestible format, not just for future myself but for my many fan(girl)s of my blog. 

Most of this post draws heavily from the following books:

* _Atomic Habits_ by James Clear
* _The Power of Habit Habits_ by Charles Duhigg
* _How to Fail At Everything And Still Win Big_ by Scott Adams
* _Deep Work_ by Cal Newport 
* _Indistractable_ by Nir Eyal

They say the best way to learn about a new subject is to write a book about it - but I'll just do the next best thing.

### Make Systems Not Goals

Everyone makes goals, or at the very least, recognizes the importance of them.

The problem with goals however, is that they are temporary targets. 

Very quickly, they make you realize that the hedonic treadmill is a real thing - once you achieve a goal, any momentary happiness you get from it fades away quickly. 

It's a matter of staying satisfied - would you rather have a restrictive goal that boxes you into a narrow way of thinking, or develop a system that makes you satisfied any time it's running?

The difference between a system and goal is the difference between:

"Ok, once I get into my dream school and my dream program I'll be happy" and "I'm going to allocate 2 hours a day to studying this subject I'm really interested in, here's how I will be studying, and here are the extra resources I can consult to verify my understanding"

The point is that you can achieve the goal just by following the system, without ever explicitly focusing on the goal.

### You Are What You Do

|*Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become*|
|:--:|
|- James Clear, Atomic Habits |

Your habits are most profoundly affected by your system of beliefs of *who you believe yourself to be*, 
and this system of beliefs in turn guides your own system of actions, which in turn forms your identity. 

The more pride you have in maintaining some aspect of identity, the more likely you are to maintain that habit.
The more you maintain that habit, the more the identity is reinforced, creating a positive feedback loop.

The most obvious example of this are people who are obsessed with health and fitness - not only is that identity built inwardly as "Oh I want to be a healthy and active person", the identity is a very obvious part of their physical appearance.

Contrast this to an outcome based goal, like losing 20lbs, which may be a good goal that you achieve, 
but with just the outcome in mind, there may not be any incentive to keep that 20lbs off. 

That's why a belief is important - if you strongly _believe_ that being a healthy and active person is part of who you are,
then that incentive is always there.

Systems of beliefs can also be negatively impacting you. If you identify as a type of person who doesn't do something, 
then you might never stick with a habit that's actually good for you. 

Saying "I'm not a morning person" does not give you an excuse to stay in bed for 12 hours every day.

### Look For Small Wins

The process of shifting identity is noted as a two step process in Atomic Habits:

1. Decide the type of person you want to be (work backwards from the result)
2. Prove it to yourself with small wins

For myself I would ask, "Who is the type of person who can write a book?"

Probably someone who is consistent and dedicated, and reads a lot of other people's works.

Then I would take small steps: read more articles, read more books, write more consistently, and seek more feedback.

As you take small steps, those actions slowly start to form your identity and push you to take more frequent and more substantial steps.

People get overly ambitious. You are not in a movie, and you don't wear a cape.

If I had started by flat out saying "OK I'm gonna write a book," I would probably never write a single page, 
and I would never have anything related to writing as part of my identity, because the inertia against actually doing anything would never be overcome.

Doing 20 push ups for 5 minutes every day is better than saying "I'm going to go for a 5 mile run tomorrow!" while tomorrow arrives.

### Laws of Behaviour Change

Habits are commonly described using a four step pattern that our brain plays out without us realizing it.

|:--:|
| _Loop de loop_ |

#### 1. Cue: Make It Obvious/Invisible

Something triggers your brain to initiate some behaviour. 

Today a lot of the cues we spend our time on are digital, like getting a notification on your phone, 
but this is also primal stuff like suddenly getting thirsty, feeling itchy, or getting h-ungry.

In order to form good habits, make the *cue* for the habit obvious, like leaving a book on your bedside to remember to read before going to bed (design your environment to make it obvious). 

Or having phone notifications that tell you to perform your habits. Smartphone notifications were **meticulously engineered** to be very powerful cues. Take advantage of them.

In order to break bad habits, make the *cue* for the habit invisible, like leaving your phone in a different room while working. 

On my computer, I have script that I run adds unproductive sites like Youtube or Reddit to my hosts file so I can't browse them. You can also set-up something like a local DNS server that filters these sites out as well, using a Pi-Hole or some similar device. 

If you don't really need the internet, just unplug the modem.

Also good tips, from Atomic Habits:

* **Implementation intentions**: "I will [BEHAVIOUR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]
* **Habit Stacking**: After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]

#### 2. (Craving)  Make It Attractive/Unattractive

Cravings are what actually motivate you to do something. 

We eat not necessarily because we are conscious that we need put molecules of food into our bodies for fuel, but because we get the feeling of fullness and the satisfaction of tasting food, which we are very familiar with.

Thoughts, feelings and emotions transform a cue (e.g. feeling hungry) to a craving (wanting to eat food).

In order to form good habits, make the *craving* for the habit attractive. How to do this is a little less obvious, but some suggestions that work for me are:

* **Create a motivation ritual**: I flex in the mirror and tell myself how great I am for doing what I'm about to do, whether it be some coding, a workout, or just reading a book.
* **Join a culture where your target behaviour is the norm**: It sounds pretty obvious, but say I want to read more, I should hang around people who like to read more. Having some feeling of being in an "ingroup" and having behaviour accepted by your group weighs heavily on your processes of taking actions.

Again, breaking bad habits is very much a mirror of the tips above. Try to avoid people who perform those bad habits, and try to highlight the negative effects of those bad habits.


#### 3. (Response) Make It Easy/Difficult

Between getting a cue (feeling hungry), having that craving (wanting to taste food and feel full), there lies a step which requires you to actually put food into your mouth and chew - this is the response.

Make the response for a good habit easy, and a bad one difficult. Here are some tips that worked for me:

* **Use a two minute rule**: Start by saying "I'll just spend two minutes working on this." That way even if you really don't want to do it, you know that two minutes is not such huge time commitment. More often than not, you'll somehow yank the motivation out of the air to work further than you intentionally thought.
* **Prime the environment/Reduce friction**: Transform your environment such that it is easy to take future actions. For the fitness example: Invest in a home gym.
* **Automate habits when possible**: A lot of helpful habits that used to require manual intervention can now mostly be automated, thanks to our good friend technology, like investing, purchasing groceries, automatically blocking unproductive websites, use email filters
* **Use One Time Actions that pay Returns**: Buy a good mattress, wear an eye mask and ear plugs to sleep, buy a water filter, mute group chat notifications


#### 4. (Reward)  Make It Satisfying/Unsatisfying

This last step is hardest to remember. It's linked to craving, because this is what the craving seeks for. The bigger the reward, the bigger the craving.
It's the feeling of "Ahhh that pizza was so good and I feel nice and filled." 

* **Don't break the chain**: Jerry Seinfeld once said that the reason he got so good at being a comic was because he made it a habit to write at least one joke a day. He would draw an 'X' in a calendar day each time he did it, and the chain of X's would motivate him to keep writing jokes, because he didn't want to break the chain (he would permit himself to miss once in case of special circumstances, but never twice - that way he would get back on track immediately). He got a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment just by keeping the chain going. 
* **Make yourself accountable**: If I tell someone close to me I'm going to do something and don't do it, I'll feel really bad, so being accountable for what I say I'm going to do works espeically well for me.  On the other hand, if I do accomplish my goal, I get that nice ego boost from the fact that someone else knows about it 

### Schedule Every Minute

The most productive period in my life I ever had was when I followed a schedule religiously, in my first couple years of undergrad.  For every minute of my time, there was no confusion on what I should be doing. 

Was it mentally exhausting? 

At times yes, but that's only because I had no value for leisure time. If I were to relive that experience, I would make sure to schedule some time for leisure just to remain sane.

At the time, it paid dividends, I was ranked second in my class in terms of academic rankings. I ended up getting an internship I had really enjoyed and looked impressive on a resume. 

My identity back then was to be the smartest engineer I could be. My system was to study and understand as much as the material as I could, and prepare and understand as much as I could for interviews and the interviewing process. Whatever success I achieved was as a result of the system and process which I took satisfaction in. 

Some people can probably remain productive without so much scheduling, but personally I find that's not the case.


### Make It Actionable 

Those are all my (hopefully) easily digestible notes on forming habits, systems, and deep work. I plan to expand this page quite a bit, especially on how to handle introspection properly.

Here's an even shorter summary:

* See if you can transform goals into systems
* Write down your system of beliefs
	* Decide who you want to be
		* Prove it with small wins 
	* Try to identify actions that you aren't doing that you maybe should be doing because of your "i'm not" statements 
		*  e.g. I'm not a good public speaker, I'm not a baker, I'm not a writer, I'm not a gymbro
* Schedule 1-2 hr blocks at a time deliberately, and schedule specific time and activities for lesiure
* Use and understand the four laws of behaviour change to your advantage:
	1. Make it obvious
	2. Make it attractive
	3. Make it easy
	4. Make it satisfying
