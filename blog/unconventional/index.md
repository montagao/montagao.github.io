Every morning after I workout, I like to hang myself upside down by the ankles, supported by a pair of gravity boots, for four to five minutes at a time. [[^1]] After that, I'll eat a spoonful of raw honey, and during my first meal of the day I'll eat a couple cloves of raw garlic. 

Did any of that sound... unconventional? Is it something that would make you think, _wow what a weirdo_? Well you're not in the wrong. If a younger version of myself had met me now, he would probably think of me as a kind of... eccentric person. He would probably would try to stay far away from me (not just because of the garlic breath either).

Why? As a kid, I thought the goal was to be conventional. In other words, the more like everyone else I was, the more I blended in, I rationalized, the better time I would have. This is what school and social dynamics teach you, since people who were _too_ off the rails usually got bullied.  

Being "coventional" became my entire identity as a twelve year old Canadian born Chinese kid. I found a neat little box of what society, my peers, and my parents would expect of me: the typical asian kid who was good at math, mild-mannered, socially awkward, wore goofy looking glasses, and would grow up to be a doctor or engineer. Wanting to fit as well as I could into my newfound pigeonhole, I would gravitate towards activities and hobbies that would fit me better into this box, and reject anything outside my comfy little box. In other words: reject anything _unconventional_ for the _identity_ I chose to play. Video games over sports. Math over girls.

It's not to say that I didn't enjoy these things. I found that I was "good at computers," and I'd be lying if I said it didn't feel good to tinker around and play with electronics, or solve math problems with praise from all my teachers. It's just that the labels of being "good at math" and "good with computers" actually had a limiting effect, and I didn't even realize how limiting they were.

It was a self-fulfilling prophecy. 

Some time ago, the norm was decided for how Asian dudes should act, and millions of little Asian boys across North America just went along with it. [[^2]] Growing up, some kids were told that they could be anything. As for Asian kids... well you get the idea. Let's just say I've never heard of a little Asian boy wanting to be a fireman.

Maybe it's a bit odd for me to say all this as a 23-year old software engineer with a degree in Computer Engineering. My point isn't to say that being an engineer or doing conventional things is bad. Conventions must exist for a reason. They represent the path most traveled, and sure, in the end they'll probably lead you to some predictable destination of a successful career, and content life.  

But some of the most valuable things I've experienced in life occurred when I've done things that were _unconventional_.

Back to my point about hanging upside down, eating raw garlic and honey: to me, these are all things that a year ago seemed very unconventional. Now, by incorporating these into my routine, I've experienced no injuries, zero back pain, and haven't gotten sick in over a year. Of course, this is just anecdotal evidence, but there are studies [[^3]] to back [[^4]] me up too.

My argument is that you shouldn't reject unconventionality outright.   

What may be unconventional to you may represent the status quo to someone else, and you should have the mindset of "Hmm, he must know something I don't". 

Be more deliberate in your dismissal of new ideas or activities. As a corollary, don't label yourself - when you define yourself in a certain way, not only will people have expectations of you, you can start to pigeonhole yourself into that label.

Think about what being unconventional means to you currently, and if maybe there's something worth exploring in those unconventionalities.

As for me, there's nothing like literally flipping my world upside down to get a new perspective from time to time.
