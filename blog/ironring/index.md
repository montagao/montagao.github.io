In Canadian engineering schools, there's a longstanding tradition of receiving and wearing an iron ring upon completing your undergraduate engineering education - it's something we are told about from first year and something we look forward to until our senior year. It's supposed to remind us of our duty as professionals to maintain a high standard of ethics and humility as we progress in our careers, and our duty to protect and serve society. (If you want to read a relevant boring blurb written 100 years ago see [here](https://ironring.ca/background.php).)

For students, it usually has an altogether different meaning. It's a physical representation of the pain and struggle we endured for five years trying to work towards our goal. Long, sleepless nights of studying, practicing for interviews, and terrible group projects, all which make us question our decision of even going to University, let alone engineering.

For me it represents all that, but I want it to have some special meaning to me too. I've associated it as constant reminder (how many times has this phrased been typed before) to not be afraid to fail, a reminder that there is no such thing as being bad or good at something, but instead, "inexperienced" and "experienced". It says that those who try and risk things not only win, but are happier and experience more out of life. The proof is in the interviews I've failed and succeeded in, the games of love I've failed and succeeded at, and all the other things I've failed at but learned from and succeeded at in the end.

It serves as a reminder that the world doesn't serve anyone, and anything you want in the world you have to earn for yourself. Whether that mean studying your ass off, getting the balls to talk to that girl you have a crush on, or applying a million times to your dream company, you shouldn't make excuses.

You should just take action. For every excuse, you should turn that into a game plan into becoming a better person. Especially you (Monta), who is born in a first world country, with a roof over their head, food to eat, high speed internet and enough disposable income to basically buy anything you really need to have fun, survive, and innovate.

Yes, the iron ring is my Nike slogan.  Just do it. Serves me better than just as some reminder not to build bad bridges.
