On one scorching summer day in Ottawa, I remember waiting for a bus. This particular bus was always late, and always disappointing. But still I waited, since I had no other way of getting home. The arrival of the bus was completely out of my hands, yet it had complete control of my life, each and every day, for about 10-20 minutes. 

It's a funny thing, isn't it? Strangers waiting for a bus. Even more fun when there's no way to tell when it will arrive. You can feel everyone get slightly more and more antsy the longer they wait.

Ten minutes pass. Then fifteen. After twenty minutes, you can feel the air becoming heavy with a little frustation. We're not *physically* trapped, yet it feels that way. 
At this point, it's all sunk cost, and we're all betting that as soon as we leave the bus it will come strutting by and sneer at us.

In some ways it's a real metaphysical routine. We're all connected, depending on the same thing, with all the same short term purpose: *Get me out of here, get me where I need to go.* 

Our lives intertwine for that entire block of time, usually without saying a word. It never seems right to start a conversation with a stranger at a bus stop. There's a sense of hurry, and people aren't in the best of moods. They're probably either coming from a long day of work, or just about to head into one.

Not to mention that there's usually never anything interesting to talk about near a bus stop, either. The most you'd be asked at a bus stop would be "Oh when's it coming?" or "Oh does this go to so and so?" and that would be that. Maybe it's because one might think that a bus will come at any minute and rudely interrupt any meaningful conversation. 

I usually don't think about what's going on in strangers' minds. But once in a while, I like to imagine about what a stranger waiting for a bus is thinking. All these people with their own inner voice, and own crazy imaginations, living out their own game of life. And here they're stuck at the same checkpoint as you. 

A real moment of [sonder](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sonder).

In any case, nothing you do can make the bus come faster - so you might as well enjoy the wait while you can. Or at least, not sulk about it.

It seems that usually when the bus finally comes, you'll have forgotten about all the time you spent waiting anyway.
