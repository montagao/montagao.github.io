 **135**
 **225**
 **315**
 **405**

To most people these numbers are completely arbitrary.  

But to a select [[^1]] group of obsessed gym junkies, fitness freaks, and competitive powerlifters these numbers actually seem to mean something. 

People will talk about the first time they bench pressed 225lbs with some weird air of nostalgia, like it was their first kiss.

...No?

Maybe it's just me then. But let's start from the beginning.

I remember always hating gym class. 

In elementary school I was the slightly chubby kid with glasses that people picked last whenever we played softball. In middle school I started to fit myself into the "guy who only reads books and plays videogames" box and was content with fitting there, for the time being. In high school, the highest mark I got in a PE class was a project for the sex ed. portion of the curriculum, which involved making colorful brochures about STDs.

The most exercise I used to get was when my dad would force me to a do a push up for every minute of screen time I wanted on the computer [[^2]], or make me shovel snow in the winter. 

I never felt shameful about my body, but my mind has shifted in the past years. 

For personal reasons, my entire attitude on health, longevity, and my relationship with my own body, has inverted. 

I wanted to look better, feel better, and overall just be happier, and I got under the impression that lifting would be the best foundation for all three. 

Anecdotally, I've never met someone who was jacked who wasn't _also_ confident and high performing in other aspects of life. 

It's immediate visual evidence that you are a disciplined person and understand how to build competency in a skill through consistency and dedication. 

It's a symbol of that which you can't buy, steal, or inherit.

It's a skill in which the [Dunning-Kruger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect#:~:text=The%20Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger%20effect%20is,recognize%20their%20lack%20of%20ability) effect is near impossible, since you can either lift that weight or you can't (which sadly doesn't stop people from grossly overestimating themselves and hurting themselves anyway).

It's also a skill with very well defined milestones with no subjectivity, that everyone can follow along with: how much can you lift?  

There are many equally valid lifts to compare, but since bench is the one that's memed about the most in popular [culture](https://youtu.be/SuBx0oy__EI?t=120), I'll just say overall strength level â‰ˆ max bench (which is flawed, but let's move on). 

### 135

The first time I ever picked up a barbell was in 2016, a week after my birthday. 

I went to a Planet Fitness, a bizarre, all-nonsense gym that gives out free pizzas and bagels [[^3]] to its members who were also trying to lose weight. It's that gym that blares sirens for anyone making too loud of a grunt, wearing too small of a shirt, or having too mean of a face.

It was a joke of a gym, but because it got me started, it has a special pizza-and-bagel-shaped place in my heart.

In the beginning I was impartial to bench press.

I liked squats the most, since that was the one where I could lift the most weight, and felt the most sore afterwards, so I actually felt like I was doing something. 

I always confused why it was called a _bench press_ [[^4]] when the fact that you lie on a bench while doing it seemed hardly important to the exercise at all. It's not like you can do it on a park bench either - it's all very misleading. Why's a squat not called a _floor squat_? Or a pullup a _bar pullup_?

<!---I also thought doing a 3x5 bench meant getting a bench in some specific dimension, which seemed like an oddly specific thing to need, especially since some programs would ask for a 5x5 bench. 

Where do I find a square bench? 

Very quickly my friend explained to me the concept of sets and repetitions, and 3x5 meant doing 3 sets of 5 repetitions. Oh. Right. --->

Anyway. Back to 135.  

My first time I couldn't even do half of 135. 

At first I loaded up the bar itself, and if I pushed myself really hard with piss poor form I could do just a bit more than the bar, for a whopping total of 50lbs. 

But I pushed myself really hard! 

And applied myself every time with motivational music! 

And soon enough...

I was still nowhere near 135lbs. Shit. 

And I learned my first lesson: **Patience**.

No matter how much of a noob I was, or how weak I felt, the one thing that I had going for me was that I remained consistent.  

Near the beginning of the next year, after googling "how to bench" dozens of times, I hit it. Two 45lbs plates on each side. 

I can actually claim that I lift now right?  I was happy for about a day, maybe two. 

But soon another thought crept into my head.

_Well I hit 135. Might as well hit 225 right?_

### 225

For a long time, the idea of benching 225 was something distant, something mythical: a pipe dream. 

I would stall at 155lbs. I would stall at 175, and then at 185lbs. I would push myself a bit too much, get injured, and go all the way back to 155lbs. I got overzealous in "getting big" and got pretty fat from free company food, so it's not like I looked that great either[.](/assets/yahoo.htm)

At times I felt like Sisyphus working so hard for seemingly no progress. 

Unlike Sisyphus though, I found that I loved the process.  

Lifting weights, once I got past the initial fear of judgment, was, and still is, incredibly addicting. 

The idea of treating my own body as a canvas, something I could iterate and continuously improve on, just like the mind itself, was enlightening to me. The idea of your own body giving you almost near immediate feedback on your efforts was something I didn't find in many other things. [[^5]]

This was the stage where my obsession seemed to take on a life of its own, like a drug addict needing a fix.

List of dumb gym related stuff I've done while trying to hit 225:

* Snuck into a 24hr gym at night with no membership (multiple times)
* Ate nearly 200g of protein and 3200 calories every day for six months
* Ate some variant of chicken breast and rice everyday for basically a year
* Pretended to be my brother to get into an LA fitness [[^6]]

I would say this is the stage which I was most dedicated as well, waking up at 6:00AM everyday to bus to the gym next to my work, five days a week, bringing in bottles of honey to the locker room (and ignoring the weird looks) to fuel my workouts. 

It seemed like the stars aligned at this point, I kinda knew what I was doing now, and I actually looked like I lifted.

On July 19th, 2018, nearly two years after I started going to the gym, I hit 2 plates. 225lbs. After countless weeks of 205, 215, 220, I did it, and I felt like a graduated from some School of Iron.

But like most new grads, my brain again shifted to another place.

_What now?_

### 315

|No man has the right to be an amateur in the matter of physical training. It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable.|

Like most people, 2020 shook up my routine a bit. I stopped lifting for a few months completely - I couldn't, even if I wanted to, because of the lockdowns. Like much of the rest of the world, I also got a bit distracted by the possibility of impending doom of civilization as we knew it.

Some time in March, I figured that if the world is gonna end, I might as well go and buy a home gym. And I soon learned that buying gym equipment as an adult was basically like buying legos as a kid, and I got excited with each new purchase: my gravity boots, my olympic rings, a lifting belt, fat grips, etc.

For the rest of the year, I focused on process and not goals. I realized that even after benching for what seemed like so long, every single session I could improve my technique in some way, whether that was my breathing, my stance, or manipulating my mindset and condition before the lift itself. 

I learned how to thrive off of intensity and use raw emotions and adrenaline to gain seemingly hidden pockets of strength.

Before I even really took it in, I hit 300lbs, and at that point I set a goal to hit 315 before the end of the year. On Nov 26, 2020, in a grinder of a set, I reached my goal. 

I'd be kidding myself if I said I had any intention of stopping soon.

### "You're Jacked For No Reason"

I'm not a professional fighter, personal trainer, firefighter, male stripper or anything like that. 

In fact my profession basically needs no physical prowess at all. Why do I want to get so strong?

Maybe the term **antifragile** is appropriate here. 

Antifragile (as coined by Nassim Taleb) is defined as the true opposite of _fragile_: a system that improves and benefits after being exposed to shocks, stressors, and disorders, which is what lifting really heavy weights basically revolves around.

But I believe the antifragility that lifting weights brings you translates well into mental strength. Mental anchors work. The feeling of elation you get from breaking a new personal record in the gym carries itself into everything you do. 

Because at the end of the day, I belive in treating the mind and the body as a whole, and something that benefits from continual improvements of either aspect.

[^1]: It just so happens that the standard plate is 45 lbs and the standard bar is also 45 lbs. 
[^2]: Considering how much time I actually spent on the computer, I should've been jacked. Must have been doing cheat push ups.
[^3]: [This whole thing reads like satire, but it's straight from their website...](https://www.planetfitness.ca/newsroom/press-release/planet-fitness-throws-biggest-pizza-bagel-and-workout-party-planet)
[^4]: It makes sense to me now, because there are two main types of presses: bench and overhead. Still, it would probably make more sense to call them _standing_ and _lying_ presses.
[^5]: Video games also do give that immediate feedback too, as well as programming
[^6]: We don't even look alike
