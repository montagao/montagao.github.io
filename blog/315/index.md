 **135**
 **225**
 **315**
 **405**

To most people these numbers are completely arbitrary.  

But to a select (imperial loving)[[^1]] group of obsessed gym junkies, fitness freaks, and actual competitive lifters these numbers actually seem to mean something. 

People will talk about the first time they bench pressed 225lbs with some weird air of nostalgia, like it was their first kiss.

No?

Maybe it's just me then. But let's start from the beginning.

### 135

I remember always hating gym class. 

In elementary school I was the slightly chubby kid with glasses that people picked last. The most exercise I used to get was when my dad would force me to a do a push up for every minute of screen time I wanted on the computer [[^2]], or make me shovel snow in the winter. 

I never felt shameful about my body, but my mind shifted in those past few years. For some personal reasons, my entire attitude on health, longevity, and relationship with my own body had started to invert. 

I wanted to look better, feel better, and overall just be happier [[^3]], and I got under impression that lifting would be the best foundation for all of that. Anecdotally, I've never met someone who was jacked who wasn't also confident and high performing in other aspects of life. 

In a way, it's immediate visual evidence that you are a disciplined person and can understand how to build competency in a skill through consistency and dedication. It's not something you can buy, steal, or inherit. The only way was through work ethic, a fact and quality which I respect to this day.

The first day I ever picked up a weight was in July 2016, a week after my birthday. 

I went to a Planet Fitness, a bizarre, all-nonsense gym that gives out free pizzas and bagels [[^4]] to its members who were also apparently trying to lose weight. It's that gym that blares sirens for anyone making too loud of a [grunt](https://youtu.be/UXP6WaVTJpM), wearing too small of a shirt, or having too mean of a face.

It was a joke of a gym, but because it's what got me started, it has a special pizza-and-bagel-shaped place in my heart.

I always confused why it was called a _bench press_[[^5]] when the fact that you lie on a bench while doing it seemed hardly important to the exercise at all. It's not like you can do it on a park bench either - it's all very misleading. Whys a squat not called a _floor squat_? Or a pulp a _bar pullup_?

I also thought doing a 3xi bench meant getting a bench in some specific dimension, which seemed like an oddly specific thing to need, especially since the next day I would have to do a 5xi bench. 

Where do I find a square bench? 

Very quickly my friend explained to me the concept of sets and repetitions, and 3xi meant doing 3 sets of 5 repetitions. Oh. Right.

Anyway. Back to 135.  

The first time I bench pressed I couldn't even do half of 135. At first I loaded up the bar itself, and if I pushed myself really hard with piss poor form I could do just a bit more than the bar, for a whopping total of 50lbs. 

But I pushed myself really hard! And added more weight every time! 

And soon enough...

I was still nowhere near 135lbs. 

All I wanted was to look at those two shiny plates on both sides of the bar. 

Then I'd be happy.

No need to get much stronger than that! _Ah. So naive._

No matter how much of a nub I was, or how weak I felt, the one thing that I had going for me was that I remained consistent. 

Then, near the beginning of the next year, I hit it. 

Two 45lbs plates on each side. I finally got my name on the board, I felt. 

I was happy for about a day, maybe two. 

But soon another thought crept into my head.

_Well I hit 135. Might as well hit 225 right?_

### 225

For a long time, the idea of benching 225 was always just a pipe dream to me, something distant, something mythical. 

I would stall at 155lbs. I would stall at 185lbs. I would push myself a bit too much, get injured, and go all the way back to 155lbs. 

At times I felt like Sisyphus working so hard for seemingly no progress. 

Unlike Sisyphus though, I found that I loved the process, whether or not I was making much progress at all.

Lifting weights, once I got past the initial fear of judgment, was and still is incredibly addicting. I started to love the whole gym culture which was surprisingly intellectual, supportive and welcoming. 

The idea of treating my own body as a canvas, something I could would and shape, was enlightening to me. At what point did it become an obsession?


I started to realize that getting physically stronger had changed the way I carried myself in a room.

After only a few weeks I started calling my friends "bra's" and flexing what little muscles I had in the mirror.

* living in Ottawa
* after Singapore, stomach flu
* breaking up with an ex?

### 315

I learned how to thrive off of intensity.

* chilling at home, home gym times
* break up?




### "You're Jacked For No Reason"

* why do I still lift? Probably past the point of diminishing returns on health benefits
	* makes me stronger mentally 
	* makes me stronger physically (obviously, anti fragility)
	* keeps me focused on systems and processes rather than goals.


{:reffed: .footnotes}
[^1]: It just so happens that the standard plate is 45 lbs and the standard bar is also 45 lbs. 
[^2]: Considering how much time I actually spent on the computer, I should vi been jacked. Must have been doing cheat push ups.
[^3]: Just like the Radiohead song
[^4]: [This whole thing reads like satire, but it's straight from their website...](https://www.planetfitness.ca/newsroom/press-release/planet-fitness-throws-biggest-pizza-bagel-and-workout-party-planet)
[^5]: It makes sense to me now, because there are two main types of presses: bench and overhead. Still, it would probably make more sense to call them _standing_ and _lying_ presses.
