I started writing my thoughts on a consistent basis (call it a diary if you really want) around five years ago, around the time I started college. At the time, I didn't think too much of it. It was something to do when I was bored, and I figured in a few years when I read and reflect on my past self it would be entertaining for everyone involved.

I also wasn't very good at it. Not that I didn't know how to write in English, or I didn't know how sentence structures worked. I did pretty well in English academically, but that was the problem. Looking back, my writing then was pretty soulless, basically too academic. Like something out of a textbook, or something a computer program would come up with.

Here's the entry on my journal, marked September 13th, 2015

| Tomorrow is the day I officially start at the University of Waterloo.  In many ways I feel like many things have culminated to this point. While I hold sentiments of nervousness, fear, and loneliness, I also feel an intense sense of excitement, pride, and ambition. Uneasy and stepping forward with trepidation, I now embark on what seems to me as the long and unforeseeable journey of my adult life.  |

I mean, what I wrote was proper English, for sure. But it sure as hell didn't represent what I actually thought. I tried to write in a way that represented what my "idea" of writing should be, based on the books and articles I've read, instead of just writing from the top of my head, and not worrying what people thought of it. I was still stuck in the doctrined mindset, as if I was writing for some teacher or organization, and not for myself.

Today when I write I constantly keep that thought in the back of my mind. I don't have to write the best prose, or come up with the best words, but as long as what I'm writing is as close to a one-to-one representation to my actual stream of thoughts, I consider the writing useful. I write to represent myself. The lack of filter, something that can't necessarily translate to a face-to-face conversation as easily, is one of the best merits of writing.

Natalie Goldberg's book _Writing Down the Bones_ captures these ideas pretty succinctly. In a nutshell, she writes:

 * Write everyday (doesn't matter how much you write)
 * Don't edit while you write
 * Use detail
 * Don't worry about being perfect
 * Take the focus *off* of the end product, and onto the process

I chose to work in an industry which is arguably naturally devoid of much creative freedom (Software Engineering), but I think everyone has a creative muscle that should be regularly exercised, just like any other muscle.

And just like any other muscle it feels good when you do exercise it, even if the exercise wasn't the most rigorous or effective. And still, my original reason to write has held true after all these years. I love reading what I've written in the past, no matter how cringy or dumb it looks now. It's one of my favorite things to do when I've had a bad day, or I'm feeling lost in life. Just like the act of writing grounds me, the act of reading what I've written in a grounded state seems to bring me right back to that state.

Writing is the connection of human thought to earth. Writing is one of the purest form of expressions humans have, and makes us uniquely human. Practice writing as often as you can, and don't worry about what you write. Even if you write garbage, something beautiful can grow out of the compost.
