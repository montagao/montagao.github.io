|_"The assignment was a piece called 'Good Eating in Hakodate' for a women's magazine. A photographer and I were to visit a few restaurants - I'd write the story up, he'd supply the photos, for a total of five pages. Well, somebody's got to write these things. And the same can be said for collecting garbage and shoveling snow. You do it because someone has to, not because it's fun. For three and a half years, I'd been making this kind of contribution to society. Shoveling snow. You know, cultural snow."_|

|- Haruki Murakami, _Dance Dance Dance_|

I've had nine jobs by the age of 23 (admittedly, six of them were internships). The shoveling snow metaphor from Murakami has stuck with me ever since reading it. The implication is that not all contributions to society are equal, even though they may be equally _important_, they are not as _fulfilling_. 

That's easy to follow. I'm sure we've all felt unfulfilled by a job at one point or another - a fact that seems to be only getting worse for each coming generation. [[^1]] 

What makes people think that they are shoveling snow _vis-Ã -vis_ their work?

**Is it just a matter of perspective?**

In the book, the character writes about restaurants and clearly feels empty doing it. I write essays for this site, but I always feel positively driven to do so. So clearly the base act, writing, is not the culprit. 

It must be the _why_ that matters. 

Obviously Murakami feels the same way. 

He probably wouldn't have left his comfy gig as a jazz bar owner to write over 31 novels if he didn't...

**Is it a clash of self-identity and reality?**

I believe that people tend to think the best for themselves. People would like to think of themselves as hardworking, intelligent, rational, creative etc. Unfortunately, they end up with a job that challenges this identity.

_If I'm so smart, why am I shoveling snow?_

This might explain why these jobs aren't so fulfilling. People are capable of much more than menial labour tasks, and if the individual feels there is a disconnect between their talents and their employment, it inevitably builds up resentment, or at the very least, an emotional detachment from it.

**Is it the advent of [bullshit jobs](https://www.strike.coop/bullshit-jobs/)?**

To be clear, shoveling snow is not a bullshit job, by David Graeber's definition. If no one shoveled snow, the roads would be piled up, and there would be cars in ditches every February. 

In Graeber's words, it's just a shit job, not a bullshit one.

**Is it related to salary?** 

If, for some reason, you were paid 6 figures to shovel people's driveways (but couldn't just quit), would that suddenly make you feel more fulfilled at your job?

Probably not. As tired as the trope is, money probably isn't everything.[[^2]]

### Follow the Golden Rule

My current hypothesis is that the more directly impacting you are to someone else's happiness, the less you will have this feeling of "shoveling snow" in your work.

Let's go back to 2014. Most peoples' senior year of highschool brings them back to thoughts of prom and pranks, but to me it takes me back to pizza.  

A lot of freaking pizza. [[^3]]

If I were to guess how many pizzas I've made in my life, three thousand would probably be a good estimate. Not counting garlic sticks.


In Ontario, the minimum age for working in a restaurant was 15. So when I was 16, I got dragged out of the house and basically forced to work at this pizza place I had never heard of, called Panago Pizza. I hated the idea at the time. I tried to make the excuse that it would eat into my CS self-studying time... but we both knew that was a lie.

But over time, hate grew to love.

|*Need your pizza shaped hole in you filled?*|

I was a cashier, dishwasher, food prep worker, accountant, and cook all at once. At least that's the fluff I would put on my resume. I eventually knew how to open, close, and run the whole store. 

I was the king of the castle.

Did I find that job to be shoveling snow? 

Not for a minute. It most definitely felt like work, and sometimes it was hard and stressful, but at the end of every busy shift I felt satisfied. I ended up looking forward to the adrenaline rush from orders pouring in and hearing the ticket printer sound "ttrrrrttrrrrtrrrr" every Friday evening.

And I ended up learning the following lessons:


* Don't cry over dropped pizzas
* Balls of dough are like people: malleable and with great potential, but don't stretch them too hard or you'll get a mess, and don't leave them sitting in the sun too long
* Creation gives two pleasures: the joy from the act itself, and the joy from others consuming your creation
* Creation of pizza gives three pleasures: the joy from the act itself, the joy from others consuming it, and the joy of sneaking a slice to eat yourself
* Making other people happy is the simplest and most pure form of fulfillment
* When in doubt, food makes people happy 
* When in doubt, pizza makes people happy 
* Cooking is a craft, an art, a sport, and a chore all at once
* Humans are adrenaline seeking. If you can't get this through your work, be sure to supplement (sports, dota)
* Be good with your hands ðŸ˜‰
