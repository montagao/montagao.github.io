Or alternatively: all the things I wish I learned in school instead of Calculus.

Originally, I had this article titled as "What School Got Wrong About Writing", yet when I sat down and started to think about what specifically I disliked about school, I realized "wow I have a lot of gripes about school", and decided to expand the scope.

For context, I grew up in Ontario, Canada and did all of my K-12 schooling in the same public school district. 

In terms of rankings, all of the schools I attended were fairly average, so I'm guessing my experience might depict the average experience of someone growing up in North America, except that I also was in a French Immersion program from Grades 1-12. I did have post-secondary education, but since that tends to be more specialized most of the points will targeted towards primary and secondary school.

### What's the point?

One of the most common question any "troublemaking" student seems to ask in some less popular class, say Calculus, is "Why are we learning this?" which can be condensed even more to "What's the point?" to which a disgruntled teacher would usually reply "Because you need it later on life," but would really be thinking to themselves "Because I'm paid to teach it".

Let's look at the question from two different perspectives. The basic idea of school is to give children the prerequisite knowledge and skills to become an adult who can contribute something to society, to the best of their potential. In other words, increase productivity and move civilization forward, whether it be in inventing a new drug for a disease, to create thought-provoking art, build machines that transport us, build computers and systems that inform us, or at least work for the big corporations who do those sorts of things.  

Education, seen from an economic perspective, seems to be great. 

Every year we're churning out more CEOs, professors, researchers, writers, scientists, engineers, doctors, statisticians, data scientists, white collar workers, blue collar workers, and everything in-between. 

The typical ([yet somewhat debated](https://freakonomics.com/2010/01/04/in-defense-of-gdp/)) measure of progress of a country, GDP, has gone up more than twenty times since 1960 in the US alone, and before COVID, [employment rate](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/employment-rate#:~:text=Employment%20Rate%20in%20the%20United%20States%20averaged%2059.24%20percent%20from,percent%20in%20April%20of%202020.)  has been steadily going up, which should show that school is doing _something_ right, or at the very least, it isn't hurting.

Great. What if we looked at school from a more personal, more human perspective? 

Luckily, being 23, it's not that _hard_ for me to think back on my high school or even middle school days, which were about 5-10 years ago, even though I might joke about feeling old whenever my 18-year-old cousin shows me a TikTok. 

As a kid, we don't really think about the economic argument for school. Most guys just looked forward to seeing their friends, and going to gym class to play dodgeball. In fact, at some point we just stopped questioning why we had to go to school entirely (to us, essentially _kid prison_), and it was just something we accepted as a fact of life. Wake up well before 7 AM, brush our teeth, eat breakfast and go to school.  Repeat about hundred and ninety days a year, for twelve years. 

And herein lied my first gripe with school:

### School starts way too early




|*I love sleep. My life has the tendency to fall apart when I'm awake, you know?*|

It's 7:00AM and your alarm goes off. You were just in the middle of an awesome dream, flying across the Yukon, shooting lasers from your eyes, and now you're lying in bed, dazed and confused. As a kid this was one of the worst feelings in the world - I didn't even sleep that late. I just hated waking up so damn early every day, lying half asleep in bed as a kid and thinking "What's the point?" [[^1]]

|*me_irl*|

There's been a [bunch of studies](https://www.cdc.gov/features/school-start-times/index.html#:~:text=The%20American%20Academy%20of%20Pediatrics,adolescents%20start%20school%20too%20early) on the topic so I won't harp on it too much, but the importance of sleep, especially in teens, wasn't common to me or anyone I knew, when I was a kid. Everyone just thought teens were lazy for always wanting to sleep in.

Later on I found out that teens need 8-10 hours of sleep (way more than the 6-7 I got on a good day), and _not_ getting that much sleep could lead to: 

* becoming overweight
* depression
* poorer judgment and focus
* worse performance in school

Also finding out years later that this heinous theft of my sleep may have [impacted my brain development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescent_sleep#Developmental_changes) certainly doesn't make me like school any more.

The main argument against later school times has been the fact that it wouldn't match well with the typical white collar parents' nine-to-five work schedule, and so, it wouldn't be able to fulfill it's secondary (or maybe main?) function: babysitting.

It's somewhat valid, but with remote work, online education, and increasingly flexible scheduling becoming the new norm for white collar workers, things should start to change, and the idea of getting enough sleep, especially while our brains need it the most, should be prioritized.

In school systems where start times are pushed later, it has demonstrably helped students. [[^2]] So not only are they happier, they learn better too.



### School doesn't care about your feelings

What's one skill that you will have to use at every stage of your life? 

If you guessed Calculus, Trigonometry, or knowledge of early French settlers in Canada... 

Boy, do I have some bad news for you.

The answer, based on the title of this section, is the ability to understand and manage your own emotions, something that will help you:

* build better relationships
* resolve conflicts
* move past intense feelings 

How much does school teach you about this? Nada. 

What about negotiating with other people, or using empathy tactically? How about 
mindfulness, which has been proven to improve focus, self regulation, reduce stress, and improve general mental health? Rien.

Maybe you can argue that this sort of stuff is not what school is for, and that these are skills one learns by just socializing with other kids, or through separate venues, like parents, religious outfits, etc. 

But wouldn't it be convenient to have a class or two on this stuff? At least as an elective? Seems like it would be useful for any sort of career, a lot moreso than say, geology. 


### School doesn't teach you how to learn

|*He's right, though*|

In school, most of what "doing well" came down to was being able to memorize stuff for a test.

Even the more abstract subjects like math, where you aren't directly memorizing answers, you _are_ memorizing some method of getting the answer. [[^3]]

Pythagorean theorem. Soh cah toa. Chain rule. One might remember some of these somewhat cryptic words, and the steps they entail. But are they formative? Do they help build onto some greater knowledge and understanding of math? 

The proofs behind them might, but we were never taught those proofs. And so, they're just more terms stored in our mind's dictionary. Not unlike knowing the year that the Pilgrims landed on Plymouth Rock.

Not only were we expected to mostly memorize facts in order to pass the curriculum,
we weren't even taught how to memorize things effectively.

Only when I seeked tools _on my own_ did I learn about effective ways to retain knowledge, and use different patterns of the brain to learn efficiently, such as: 

* [spaced repetition](https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition)
* [chunking](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/learning-how-to-learn/what-is-a-chunk-LurUJ)
* [focus and diffuse modes of thinking](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/learning-how-to-learn/introduction-to-the-focused-and-diffuse-modes-75EsZ)

### School makes writing a chore

|*No offence to my friends in academia*|

I remember writing a lot in school. Essays, reports, tests, etc.

What I don't remember is enjoying it a whole lot. Why? 

For the most part we are given very little freedom of what to write about, and how to write it. 

A prompt for an assignment would be something like, 

"What do you think the author meant to convey by showing Greg take the bus instead of the walking to school?" 

To which, I'd roll my eyes and write whatever bullshit I could to show that I had some grasp of the English language and satisfy the word count.

I once remember analyzing a Chipotle commercial for about **five** classes in Grade 11 English, and remember wondering if my teacher had some sort of under the table deal with Chipotle. By the end of it I never wanted to look at Chipotle again. 

_Very few_ times were we given creative freedom to write about a subject of our choice, but whenever we did, I actually enjoyed it, even if I was "inflating my weak ideas, obscuring my poor reasoning, and inhibiting clarity."
 
Another point: the hamburger (essay) method of writing was forced down our throats, yet what's the most popular form of writing in the 21st century? Blogs and tweets! Sometimes you just wanna get down to the meat of an idea, not surround it with bloated carbs.

### What School Got Right

The most valuable thing I got from school were its network effects. Almost all of my friends were from school, or tangentially related to friends I made from school. And of course, no one can argue against the value of good friends, which, to borrow from a commercial, is priceless.  

### Being Unfair

There are only so many hours in a day. Maybe it's not too fair to expect so much from school. 

Should school also teach you how to pick up chicks or how to be funny? Probably not.

After all, if school taught you _everything_ useful in life, what's there for you to explore for yourself?
