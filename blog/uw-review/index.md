description: Review of my time in Computer Engineering at UW
layout: post
---

Almost five years ago, around this time, I was about to make a decision which would ~~haunt~~ change my life forever.

In 2015, I was finishing high school and was at that period in every person's life which they really had to start thinking about which path was right for them.

Usually at this time it doesn't occur to people that they might change their mind. I chose ECE at UW, specifically computer engineering, with much influence from a [blog post I found on reddit](https://blog.minsangk.im/category/uwaterloo/) at the time by googling stuff like 'Waterloo Computer Engineering vs Computer Science"'.

Since I found a lot of usefulness in a first hand account of someone's experience of all the courses in their undergrad career at Waterloo, I thought I would return the favour.

Note that the curriculum has changed significantly from 2015. From what I know, more discrete math and less circuits for computer engineers and more prototyping/"practical" engineering courses in general.

## 1A: Fall 2015
![My 1A 2015 ECE schedule](https://i.imgur.com/ECiBg4j.png)
My schedule in first year - yeah, I studied a lot...
#### CHE 102: Chemistry for Engineers
Required chemistry course for all engineers due to accreditation requirements. Giant waste of time. Our prof was on the last few years of his teaching career and clearly wanted nothing to do with teaching ungrateful first year computer engineers - he finished all the course lectures in a month and a half. I don't remember a single useful thing from this course, except maybe how to cram for a quiz.

#### ECE 100A: ECE Practice
Joke course about "the engineering profession". Basically: "don't build bad bridges, measure twice", etc. Don't call yourself an engineer unless you're accredited by the PEO in Ontario, unless you're in the US. Those two sentences basically sum up a few hours of lectures.

#### ECE 105: Physics of Electrical Eng. I
The notorious "weed-out" course of ECE. Covers classical mechanics, and was actually mostly high school review, but the midterms and exams were notoriously hard. Most notably I remember our prof, Donna Strickland, who had a really loud voice and acted like a disappointed mother to our whole class. I remember studying harder for this course than any other course in undergrad, including going to all the late night extra help sections.

Later on our prof went on to win the Nobel Prize in Physics, so I can always brag that I'm Nobel Laureate-educated.

#### ECE 140: Linear Circuits
Intro to circuits. Learned about thrilling stuff like Ohm's Law, circuit analysis, capacitors and inductors. Our prof was Adam Neale, which apparently shares the name with some famous musician. I liked his class and I liked drawing circuit diagrams, but we never really did anything fun/practical in that class, like tinkering with electronics, like I'd expected. Later I heard the prof quit UW and went to work for Intel. Good on him, I guess.

#### ECE 150: Fundamentals of Computer Programming
Kind of a strange course. Disorganized. This was the first year the department moved from C* as was previously taught, and it showed. Effectively, we were taught C, with some primer lessons on polymorphism using C++. Our prof had a classic "hacker" type vibe but wasn't a great teacher. I noticed this trend of poor teaching more and more throughout my undergrad.


#### MATH 117: Calculus I
Taught by Matthew Kennedy - somehow I still remember his name. Soft spoken but obviously smart guy. Kept joking about how engineering majors made a lot of money and how math majors didn't - another trend I would notice more and more of from professors from the math department. Stood out to me because he referenced Asimov once, who I was a huge fan of at time after reading all of the Foundation series in high school.

Probably my first introduction to formal maths was the epsilon delta definition of a limit, which I tried to use to impress a girl once which ended about as well as you would expect.


### 1B: Winter 2016
![My 1A 2015 ECE schedule](https://i.imgur.com/A9IAq5v.png)
Since I was in Stream 8 instead of Stream 4, I had two back-to-back school terms instead of a co-op term immediately after my first school term. Probably was for the best in the long run, since looking for a job in the first four weeks of your undergrad is pretty stressful.

#### ECE 100B: ECE Practice
These are not really "courses" anymore, just random time slots for info that the department could easily replace with an email. Skip.

#### ECE 103: Discrete Mathematics
One of my favourite courses in all of undergrad. Before this course, I was really afraid of formal maths, proofs, etc. I think after this course, I was excited by it.

I liked it because it was interactive - Professor Pei would bring random toys and gadgets and class for combinatorics. He was also always really clear and taught things in an intuitive way - the way math should be. I also remember that our TA was some jacked Scandinavian dude. Not sure why I remember that, but I do. I got my highest mark ever in this course (99).

#### ECE 106: Physics of Electrical Eng. II
Electricity and magnetism course. Hardest course of the term, mainly because of all the mandatory labs and tutorials making this class take up essentially absurd amount of time a week. It also depended on Calc II knowledge, which was being taught in the same term. The prof was also a bit of an eccentric guy, who smiled a bit too often and a bit too creepily sometimes. He also starred in an "Academics in 9/11" type conspiracy documentary, which is kinda weird.

#### ECE 124: Digital Circuits and Systems
Logic gates, timing, boolean expressions, state machines. Kind of a boring subject for me, exasperated by being taught by the most monotonous prof in the world. Real life transcript of the course: "zero zero zero one one zero one one ....". I mean, did you really have to read out every single 1 and 0 in a list of like 30 binary numbers? At least I could fall asleep easily in this class. Nice afternoon nap.

#### ECE 155: Eng. Design, Embedded Systems
Infamous course with the infamous Douglas Wilhelm Harder. He used to bring out $5 bills and bribe students to answer questions because no one cared about this course. Not really his fault, since the course was so all over the place. It tried to cover everything from software development life cycles to testing to embedded systems, and did none of it particularly well.

#### MATH 119: Calculus II for Engineers
Has a crush on this prof at the time -she looked like my 10th grade English teacher, who I also had a crush on. Can't remember much about what I learned in this class, but I miss her.

Like the other Calc prof, she also liked to joke about engineers getting paid more than math majors a lot.

### Co-op 1: Spring 2016

I co-op'ed as a QA Developer. It was a swell old time. My manager used to be a DJ, and then he pivoted careers to be a test automation manager. I remember one of my coworkers used to watch TV while running the manual regression tests on the website. It was a chill job, but mindless.

Other bonuses:
* 30 minute walk from my house
* Co-op term in the summer

## 2A: Fall 2016

Infamous "Term of Death" in ECE. Don't forget to hand in your [Soul Transfer form](https://www.jasonpang.net/uw/soul-transfer.pdf)to the department at the start of the term.

###  ECE 204A: Numerical Methods 1

Basically an "intro to MATLAB" course, with some differential equations, fourier and laplace stuff thrown in. For the most part I just remember memorizing MATLAB syntax and copying and pasting code from the lab manual. For the really curious, the entire course content is available online at https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~ece204a/ but it's pretty dry stuff unless you're really into computational math.

#### ECE 205: Advanced Calculus I for ECE

One of the worst courses I've taken in ECE.

In contrast with ECE 103, there's nothing intuitive about this course - just rote memorization of formulas and processes. Supposedly we learned about first and second order ODEs, but it was all just a very mechanical and memorization heavy process.

#### ECE 222:  Digital Computers

Very useful but challenging course. Learn about ALUs, memory, CPU architecture, pipelining, CPU cycles and other parts of computer architecture. Basically a nice introduction to all the low level details about computers. Lots of labs programming in ARM assembly, which can be challenging if you have no exposure to that before hand.

Midterm average for the class ended up being 26. Enough said.

```
MAIN MOV r0, #6;
	bl KOMPUTE;
	b EXIT;
KOMPUTE	STMFD	SP!,{R4,LR}
	MOV		r4,r0
	CMP 	r0,#0

L3	SUB		r0,r0,#1
	BL 	KOMPUTE
	MUL		r0,r0,r4
	B 	L2
EXIT b EXIT


	END
```
Simple Assembly Program in ECE222.

The final lab for the course involved making a morse code interpreter using LEDs. Or something like that. It's been a while.


#### ECE 240:  Electronic Circuits I

Intro to differntial amplifiers. Very EE oriented course. Everyone hated it... even the EEs, pretty sure. The vibe in the room in every lecture was that the Prof hated our guts. Apparently she had some really tough schooling (she went to Peking University and then did her masters at Stanford and her Post-Doc at MIT or something) and didn't have any sympathy for our complaints of how much work we claimed we had.

It's kind of sad, but I think this is the trap that people who choose Computer Engineering fall in. We all take it because we think "Oh yeah I can learn hardware too I like electronics", but we take a course like 240 which feels so separated from anything practical (even though it is) that it's a bit demotivating to pursue any hardware stuff.

I understand that this stuff is fundamental for learning more cool stuff with electronics, but I sort of wish the way it was introduced wasn't so dry. Maybe an analogy would be learning to cook, but only learning how to make sauces for four months before moving onto anything else. It's definitely important, but it lacks the **meat** which makes it interesting.

*"Wtf is a BJT man. I just wanted to build cool stuff with arduinos." - typical CE student at Waterloo.*

#### ECE 250: Algorithms and Data Structures

Classic CS course, but taught in the ECE department so it's shittier. Hmm, sensing a pattern here. Obviously a useful course for interviews, althought I'd be lying if I said it was better than just going through one of the well known books on DS+A. Just remember the prof being a jovial Iranian lady, like a distant and loud aunt. She loved talking in the third person.


*"Salam!"*

#### ECE 290: Ethics
Ok I take it back. _This_ was the worst course in ECE. With Jeff "Robot" Zarnett, whose jokes were also generated by machine learning.

#### MATH 215: Linear Algebra

Can't say much about this course except the prof had a sick mustache liked to yell a lot and bang the chalkboard eraser on the table a lot. The course itself was very mechanical and we didn't really learn much intution for linear algebra, mostly just memorized formulas and processes again.

At this point I really started to dislike any math heavy courses in ECE, for the reasons above. I still got good grades, but the motivation and passion I had for learning maths was being beat down by these very mechanical courses.

### Winter 2017

I co-oped in Waterloo as a software dev. I worked on some frontend database applications. Also made friends with some cool upper year ECE folks, and we shared greivances about the program.

That's one thing everyone in the program had in common - we all hated it in some way.

### 2B: Spring 2017

First school term in the summer. At this point I was playing a lot of smash with my housemates. No real debauchery here.

#### ECE 207: Signals and Systems

Course about signal processing. Largely useless as a software dev, but good to know I guess. I still don't really know what a convolution is. *Sounds convoluted.*

#### ECE 242: Electronic Circuits II

Electric Boogaloo. With the legendary Vincent Gaudet, also known as Bill Gates' more handsome brother.

Learn more about BJTs. (No it's not something naughty, I promise.)

#### PHIL 245: Critical Thinking

Took a critical thinking course online. Really made me think.

I took this course with the same amount of care I took with a lot of my other electives - that is, not much at all.

#### ECE 254: Operating Systems

Hated this course. Labs were confusing and uninteresting. Got carried by my lab partner. Prof Zarnett showed up as the Terminator on Halloween. Very fitting.

### Fall 2017

Worked in California. Free food, pampered Silicon Valley company life. Went to Highway 1, Yosemite, Santa Cruz, Lake Tahoe, Sausalito, fun stuff in the Bay Area.

Life is good.


### 3A: Winter 2018 - National University of Singapore

In my 3A term I decided somewhat randomly to go on exchange to Singapore. Why I chose Singapore was a mix between word of mouth that Singapore was good and some weird inner draw to the City State, and weirdly because some of my favorite Dota 2 players were from Singapore.


It was one of the best decisions of my life just because I got to experience so many new things - the food, the culture, the change of scenery, it made me sad to go back to Waterloo again. If you have a chance to go on exchange - do it.


![Backpacking at Malaysia](https://i.imgur.com/8hEuwAR.jpg)
Backpacking in Malaysia, Feb 2018

Unfortunately I still had to take courses in Singapore, but they were instructed in english (the official language of Singapore) and were actually taught pretty well.

#### ECE 316 - Probability & Statistics
Basically what you'd expect from an intro to stats course in undergrad. Missed a lot of courses from food poisoning after eating raw chicken in Japan. Prof was pretty old and talked pretty slow, with a lot of "lah's" in the typical singaporean accent. I loved it.


#### ECE 356 - Database Systems
Prof was a french dude with an air of grandeur. We learned SQL, but we also learned some "formal" theory for databases like BCNF and stuff like that. Didn't really enjoy it or get the "big picture" of that course very well. Our final project was a website to assign tasks to people, like a job board.


Our final project can be seen at https://github.com/moonrobin/taskr

#### ECE 358 - Networks

I can't imagine any computer networks course being all that different from each other. Series of tubes and such. Bit dry, but fun assignments I guess. Lots of talk about Alice and Bob.


#### GENE22C: Colonial South East Asia through European Literature

As an elective I took a course where we just read books and watched movies all day. It  was real fun. We even had a class trip to some island in Indonesia.



### Spring 2018

I worked on developing IoT device application software in C.

### 3B: Fall 2018

Stopped caring all that much about school. Senioritis and such. Started drinking more. As you can see, I took 6 courses this term (overloaded) so I wasn't a huge fan of this term.

#### ECE 318: Analog and Digital Communications

Interesting course. Lots of math (fourier) involved. Biggest takeaway was learning how radios work (how frequency filters work). The concept of a "low pass filter" and "band pass filter" will forever be ingrained in my brain.


#### ECE 361: Power systems

Bad course with a cranky prof. Learned nothing.

#### ECE 390: Engineering Economics

Pointless course. Some mumbo jumbo about discounted cash flows.
What am I, an accountant?

#### MSCI 432: Operations

Easy technical elective I decided to take because I had to overload my term. Don't take unless you want a course for an easy pass and no real value. I can't even describe what this course is really about, that's how bad it was.

#### PSYCH 101: Intro to Psycho (online)

Intro to Psych, online. Doesn't get birdier than that.

#### SCI 238: Intro to Astronomy (online)

Ok, maybe it does.


### Winter 2019

I worked at Cisco Meraki in San Francisco, working on a live topology web application for their Switch appliances.


### 4A: Summer 2019

#### ECE 327: Digital Hardware Systems
At this point, I really stopped caring about school. Even though this was pretty recently finished, I remember nothing about this course, except that I asked the Prof to consult for our FYDP.

#### ECE 380: Analog Control Systems
Worst course. Won't ever use my knowledge I learned here for anything.

#### ECE 458: Computer Security
Practical course that I actually enjoyed. SQL injections, side-channel attacks, historical encrpytion vulnerabilites were all fun to learn and tinker with.

#### ECE 498A: Capstone
Also known as the Fourth Year Design Project (FYDP). We did a water gun with computer vision and cloud connectivity. It was fun. I worked on the cloud backend parts.

## Fall 2019

I worked at Splunk in San Jose, on the Cloud Infrastructure team.

## 4B: Winter 2020

The final countdown. Half of the semester got steamrolled by COVID-19 unfortunately.  My mom tells me WW3 is happening. Whatever, still gonna finish my degree I guess.

#### ECE 405: Intro to Quantum Mechanics

In an unexpected turn of events, the prof got asked to step down from teaching the course and got replaced. The course is both difficult and bird at the same time. Schrodinger's Course.


#### ECE 459: Programming for Performance
Pretty useful and modern course, though the assignments are pretty time consuming. Third course that I've taken that Prof. Zarnett has taught me. The Threepeat.


#### ECE 493: Autonomous Vehicles
Interesting course subject, but all the lectures and asssignments are just pulled from various other places online (Coursera, Stanford, MIT, etc.). So what am I paying UW for?

Anyway, topics include Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Object Detection, Control Systems, Vehicle Control modelling, behavior planning.

#### ECE 498B: Symposium

Cancelled because of COVID-19.

#### KOREA 101R: Intro to Korean

The infamous "UW is a trap" course  https://www.waterloochronicle.ca/news-story/9536487--the-university-of-waterloo-is-a-trap-student-speaks-out-about-issues-at-the-university/.

Funny old prof who had a great sense of humour and told war stories.


## Conclusion and Advice
In general, I think choosing CE at Waterloo was a great way to get a good job.

I don't think it was a good program in terms of actual educative value. Like I mentioned, the math taught is very mechanical, and the CS courses are mostly just worse versions of CS courses found at other top schools, or even CS courses at Waterloo. For a lot of my courses I used supplementary content from other places more than the actual lecture content (Coursera, Stanford, MIT Open Courseware).

I guess it really depends on how much you value employability
(vs. creativity, exploration, etc.)  as a criteria of a university education.

But all in all, in terms of getting a (software) job, most employers don't really care about what program you're in, so long as it has the name "Computer" (or something related) and it's from a well recognized school.

I will say that if I were to go back in time, I would choose CS instead for the following reasons:
* Better math education
* No more circuits
* Cheaper tuition
* More free time (?)

Pretty confident about the first 3 points, but not so much on the fourth, since althought CS students usually have less lecture time the assignments are harder and longer.
