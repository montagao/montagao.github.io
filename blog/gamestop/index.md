I once had the idea that investing isn't just some video game that involves ticker names of companies. 

I've been proved wrong. 

When I talked to one of my friends about it, he said "If it's not a game why can I do it when I'm on my toilet?" 

Which... I don't really have an answer for.

In case it's not immediately obvious, I'm alluding to the crazy case of GameStop (GME), which is up nearly 1900% YTD at the time of this writing.
Since it seems like every Tom, Sam and Pam has already covered the situation from an investing standpoint, I won't go too much into it, but the TL;DR is:

Some big hedge funds took on WAY too much risk shorting GameStop (somehow shorting more shares than available), and a large mob of retail investors caught wind and made a smart play against it - buying en masse and driving shares up. Now many of these hedge funds risk going under, and everyone is painting it as the "David and Goliath" of finance. 

As of writing, David is winning, and it's a wild ride that I predict will become even wilder this coming week. 

Now, most of this week's hubbub about GameStop brings up some pretty stark commentary on economic inequality, institutional negligence, market inefficiencies, and the influence of social media on the financial system. But I noticed something a little... lighter.

GameStop's rise is purely due to those hedge funds' [short positions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_squeeze) that I mentioned, which is being exploited like a gaping hole outside of a bank vault. 

But the whole thing is very poetic; to millions of millenials, GameStop represents the first time they had to muster up savings to buy something big, like the newest console.

Later on it would be probably be the first time they really exercised the concept of trading (legally), being able to trade in their used games for some store credit... Sort of like trading in shares of $GME for money! 

The meteoric surge of GameStop definitely won't last, but what it represents is the influx of investors who are now willing to learn the game.

Power to the players!
