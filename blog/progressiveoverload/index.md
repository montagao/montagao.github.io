### _Progressive Overload and Honing Your Craft_

In strength training, one of the most effective approaches to improvement as a beginner is linear progression. The idea is simple: whatever starting weight you may be at, every week you increment a bit more weight onto your lifts (e.g. +5 lbs). You do this for as long as you can to maximize the amount of gains you can get in your beginner months. Eventually, you'll start to plateau, but by then you should have made _sick gainz_ [[^1]] in terms of strength and physique.

As your training becomes more advanced, you will no longer be able to increment your training weights linearly (lest you risk injuring yourself and taking a trip to snap city). At this point, the only way to advance in your training is to become more creative in _how_  you can stress your muscles. 

This concept is referred to as **[progressive overload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_overload)**. The idea is almost trivial. Simply put, for any exercise you wish to progress on, you must do something different, which is _objectively_ harder than the last time you did it, whether that be the number of repetitions, a larger range of motion, more weight or greater number of sets. It could be a better focus on form, or stability. If you do this, you will see the largest overall improvement in strength/muscle growth over time.

Of course, this system works well for lifting weights because of its largely quantitative nature. At the end of the day, usually the goal is just to move more weight. But there's many advantages to this system:

* it's good for motivation because you can see your own **tangible progress** and see how far you might be from a goal
* it's good for **structure and organization** because you know exactly how much you have to push yourself each time, and it keeps you going to the gym consistently since you will have a set goal/problem you want to solve
* you can get **creative** and learn how to do a specific technique in a better way since you will force yourself to explore different options

It may be slow progress, but it's consistent progress, and for most things in life that's all that matters.

Can it be applied to things other than weightlifting?

To help answer that, I tried to identify 5 key observations as to why weightlifting and this strategy worked so well for me:

1. **I had friends to motivate me and guide me in the beginning**.
	* the initial resistance is sometimes the hardest part
2. **Working out creates a positive feedback loop**
	* inspiration -> action -> results -> inspiration
3. **The regimen/program was simple, and I could start at a low base level of competence**
	* Example: starting out, I would work out 3x a week, and start with easier exercises. Then I'd gradually add more weight and do more exercises, and train more times a week
4. **The training was structured and organized.**
	* This removed doubt about what I should do for my goals
	* Example: eat x amount of protein and calories, train at these times, etc.
5. **I had people to talk to, and resources to consult when I was lost.**
	* Minimize feelings of getting stuck

To generalize these concepts:

* **have a good network of resources to draw upon when you are blocked**
* **have a consistent schedule**
* **have a specific goal/plan for each session**
* **have a quantitative or qualitattive measure of progress**
* **start at whatever necessary base level and be realistic**
* **be proud of your own achievements**

So what other skills would work well with this framework?

I would say... pretty much anything! The only tricky part is to make sure you have a good way of measuring progress, since most skills are measured qualitatively rather than qualitatively.

For example, if I wanted to get better at writing, I would set up the following system:

1. Aim to write at 8AM on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, for 1hr
2. For every session, try to either brainstorm for new writing ideas if you have none, or expand on previously brainstormed ideas. Aim to write (without breaks) for at least 25 minutes
3. To progressively overload, prolong the writing duration, or challenge yourself to write in different styles, and different types of topics. For example, if I've done too many posts on productivity I should do something more light hearted like a book or movie review
4. Get feedback from others and consistently re-read older work to see how I've progressed in writing style  
5. Don't be afraid to start with something simple (e.g. doing reviews of courses in university) 
6. Draw inspiration from famous authors, books, and other blogs if I ever get stuck

Some people may argue that it's hard to do creative work in such a structured way, and maybe it's better to work in a more spontaneous fashion, but personally I prefer the structured time since I'm a more conscientious person. This system has worked the best for me in the past; without timely schedules of tasks I tend to get sidetracked. 

I do take advantage of spontaneity insofar as I will write down any ideas that pop into my head, and revisit those ideas more in-depth later.

In any case, the key is to experiment with what works best for you, but the concept of **progressive overload** is what truly matters. It's a mindset that will motivate you and is designed to push you to be better than you were yesterday.

Of course, none of this matters if the skill you're trying to hone isn't meaningful to you in some way. If you don't have the motivation or drive to do something, this plan falls apart ü§∑. 

This is why the step of being realistic is also important - the best exercise is the one that you actually do. If you plan to write a novel or bench press 405lbs on Day 1, you might have a bad time. Starting small is important because it helps you hit the "results" part of the feedback loop early on.
