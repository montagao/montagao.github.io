With COVID-19 lockdowns being implemented and gyms shutting down, people are buying home gym supplies in droves (driving up the price of dumbbells to [$1000 a pair](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B0746TQMKT/ref=s9_acsd_omwf_hd_bw_b2f41cx_c2_x_0_t?pf_rd_m=A1IM4EOPHS76S7&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-11&pf_rd_r=5TCFZY73GMYAT2K0DS8A&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=f461ddb8-4dc7-5b6c-ac3a-dc184c54a3a5&pf_rd_i=2439055011)) in hopes of maintaining shape for the long winter to come.

But is a home gym all that great? (Short answer? Yes.)


As a small time home gym owner [[^1]], but big time bro, I feel qualified to answer, so I've spent some time thinking of the top five reasons why someone should get a home gym.

### 1. To Blast Terrible Music 


Lone gone are the days of putting on headphones to discreetly listen to Lauryn Hill and heavy thrash metal in the same gym playlist.

Turn it up to eleven, baby.


### 2. Maximize Your Productivity

Is your work piling up? 

No time to workout? 

**No problem.**

Kill two birds with one stone by setting up your home office in your gym and work while you're working out. 

Exercise that mind and body together. 

If you're a real go-getter, you can even jump into zoom meetings while working out. 
Don't unmute your mic either - surely the panting and heaving will convince your team that you're really exerting yourself and focused on the company mission.
 
_Protip: Prop up your laptop with any 45lbs weights you have lying around, as pictured above._

### 3. Make a Temple of Iron ... And Paper?

Are people making fun of you for being a thick-skulled musclehead? 

Prove them wrong by bringing a stack of books into the gym.

Not only can you get sick knowledge gains while resting between sets, you can leverage the heavier textbooks as weights for lighter presses. 

Win-win.

### 4. Maximize Protein Intake

Every bodybuilder has heard of the anabolic window - the ~~myth~~ complete truthhood that you have to consume protein within 30 minutes of working out or else all of your gains evaporate into the ether.

Whether it's true or not, why not play it safe and eat _during_ your workout? 

Not only does it save time, the less time the food has to settle down in your body, the less likely it is to turn into fat. 

Fat molecules in your body are like ants in your house. You gotta get rid of them before they really move in and settle down. 

### 5. It's Free Real Estate

One of the most important pillars of fitness is recovery.

What better way to ensure a quality night's sleep than making your _gym_ your _bedroom_? 

Plus you can rent out your actual bedroom to earn some money on the side to help pay for $1000 pair of dumbbells you bought.

Make sure to position your ~~bench press~~ bed right under your barbell so that you can do a couple sets immediately after waking up!
